Worried about forgetting your friendâ€™s birthday, I have a solution for you! With the power 
of Salesforce flows, automating birthday reminders has never been easier. In this blog post, 
we'll explore how to set up a Salesforce flow to send birthday greetings to friends or 
contacts stored in our Salesforce org. 
We will need to store information about our friends, including their email 
addresses and dates of birth in our Salesforce Org. This could be useful for sending 
personalized birthday wishes, be manually remembering and sending these messages can 
be time-consuming. That's where Salesforce flows come in handy. With flows, you can 
automate repetitive tasks like sending birthday reminders, freeing up your time for more 
meaningful work. 


# Setting up the Flow: 
Let's dive into the step-by-step process of setting up a Salesforce flow for birthday 
reminders. 

# Step 1: Define the Object and Fields 
First, ensure you have a custom object in Salesforce to store information about your friends. 
Let's call it "Friend__c". Within this object, create fields for "Email__c" to store email 
addresses and "DOB__c" to store dates of birth. 

# Step 2: Create a Scheduled Triggered Flow 
Navigate to the Flow Builder in Salesforce Setup and create a new flow. Choose the 
"Scheduled Trigger" type for the flow. 

# Step 3: Define the Schedule 
Set the schedule to run daily or at a frequency that suits your needs. For birthday reminders, 
you might want the flow to run once a day. 

# Step 4: Query Records 
Next, add an element to query records from the "Friend__c" object where the date of birth 
matches the current date. This will retrieve records of friends whose birthdays are today. 

# Step 5: Loop through Records 
Add a loop element to iterate through the queried records. 

# Step 6: Send Email 
Within the loop, add an action to send an email to each friend whose birthday is today. Use 
the "Email__c" field to get the recipient's email address and customize the email message 
with a personalized birthday greeting.

# Step 7: Activate the Flow 
Once you've finished configuring the flow, activate it to start sending birthday reminders 
automatically.
